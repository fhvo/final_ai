Final Project for AI


Abstract:

  The Dataset that we are using in the Final Project is "Parkinsons Telemonitoring" using regression models. In the notebook we are using Pycaret as the library helper and we find the best top 3 models for regression and then perform Tuning on them after we find the lowest error scores between them then we save saved the model and re-use them again.The best performance of the model we did on the model on is Random Forest with the value of R2 equal 0.982 and RMSE equal to 1.4523.
